# Ford GoBike System Data Exploration

## Dataset

The data consists of information regarding over 2 million San Francisco Bay Area bicycle riders which include details as departure and arrival time, user gender, user birth year and other rider information.

## Summary of Findings

I thought this was going to be a straight forward and simple project based on all that I have learned from the previous projects. However, as I dived in deeper I came across some challenges with the syntax. Through patience and perseverance I was able to find the answers on-line with my friends google and stackoverflow.

As for this dataset, we started with 18 columns and added some time related columns to plot our data and make it more tidy. To be able to find the monthly, weekly, hourly data I had to create several additional columns to generate some interesting and informative columns which helped me create the graphs to visually present the data.

The data that was provided by the GoBike System seem to be an accurate usage representation of local commuters and tourists. I was able to learn that bike usage peak during commute hours for members, yet for non-member which are identified as tourist peak days seem to be during the weekend on Saturday and Sundays.

Another interesting piece of information I was able confirm during my observations is for the month of October. The San Francisco bay area is unique in that most of the year is foggy. However, during the month of October, we can enjoy fog-free weather and thus the best time to bike at golden gate park. With the bike share data, you can confirm that October has the highest ridership from any month of the year.

The data clearly captures the affects the Spare the Air program during the usual commute times of 7am-9am and 5pm-7pm. As a Bay Area resident myself, I know the pain of sitting in your car going 5 miles per hour.

Overall this was a challenging project, but I learned a lot from the research. I enjoyed it because I was able to related with the local area. I first visited the bay area in 2000. My co-workers invited me to visit. I felt in love with the Bay Area and I found a way to transfer from Denver. I've been living in the Bay Area for more than 19 years now and its an amazing place to live. Please don't take my word for it, I invite you to visit and see for yourself. This project has made me curious to try this system for myself. The next opportunity I have, I will surely give it a try.

## Key Insights for Presentation

For the presentations I focused on the usage of the bike sharing system during rush hours and then move on how the age of the user affects ridership between gender and age.. I start by introducing the age group to help identify the age group which is using the system most frequently.

Afterward, I introduced a monthly and weekly usage pattern among different types of user types such as members and non-members and how this affect ridership during different times of the year and week.

My interest was to capture how the system was being used by daily local commuters to ride a bike to work. In the Bay Area there is a program called "Spare the Air" to reduce the impact to air pollution in the Bay Area. This program encourages Bay Area residents to find alternatives to driving a car and instead use public mass transportation or other transportation alternatives such as riding a bike to work.
